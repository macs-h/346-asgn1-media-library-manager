### Object Oriented Concepts in Design and Implementation


### the way in which object-oriented concepts were used in your design and implementation;

### how you tested your code;

### if you completed the assignment in a pair, you must explain the role taken by each member of your pair; and

### if you implemented any extensions, how many bonus marks (up to 3) you believe you should be awarded, and why. Note that the bonus marks can only be used to reach the maximum mark of 20.
